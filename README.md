# alien_packages_for_clearlinux
Some packages missing in the official Clear Linux bundles

This repository provides with some compiled packages which one may need. I had spent some time compiling them, therefore you don't have to. If you want to compile it yourself, you can skip the trial-and-error part and just compile it once with success, hopefully.

The content in the repository is being provided as is and we do not offer any kind of warranty. Licensing is respective to the vendors. Blah blah best effort, no support, good luck. 

Note: I liked the optimizations in Clear Linux and hope to continue packaging. 

Please let me know if something needs to be / would be nice to be / can be improved here.
